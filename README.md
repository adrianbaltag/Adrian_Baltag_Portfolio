## Portfolio Introduction
Hi! I am Adrian, nice to meet you üëã! I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer Apprentice at Verizon.
Curious by nature, I always try to learn and be on top of the latest technologies and skills needed within the Web Dev world, just because I love what I do, and I believe in the power of continuous improvement.Whether it's exploring new programming languages, frameworks, or design principles, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and push myself to grow as a developer.


In addition to the work I have done individually as an apprentice, I have also had the valuable opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams on various projects:

- **High Paw**: Sheree, Kharmalina, Patrick
- **J.A.B(Just a blog)**: Bryan, Ahn
- **S.A.S Travel**:Sheree, Sharee


Witnessing my work come to life and witnessing the positive impacts it has on users brings me immense joy. While I have a special passion for frontend development and design, I also find great satisfaction in constructing full stack applications.


Thank you for your valuable time, and I hope you will take pleasure in exploring some of the projects in my portfolio.üòÅ
